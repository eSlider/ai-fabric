  Deduction search over the project brain (Ladybug graph: ops corpus, portfolio,
  ssh hosts) with bin/brain/search.go instead of reading files or grepping
  repos. Use whenever a question starts with "where is", "what runs on",
  "which file describes", "who is", "how is X done", before opening any
  documentation.

# brain — deduction over facts and info

One embedded Ladybug graph (`var/kb.lbug`, read-only when queried) holding two
roots:

- **facts** — assertions backed by ≥2 independent sources (docker ps × compose
  × ssh-config × docs), `confidence: confirmed`.
- **info** — descriptive/narrative leafs, searchable, never asserted.

Search = deduction: facts root first, info root second, `web-search` as the
second independent source when local roots cannot confirm. An answer is
`confirmed` only if it comes off the facts root; anything else is
`(not confirmed)`.

## Corpus — what lives in the brain (#198/#199)

`info` holds the WHOLE corpus, never just one root. Current composition
(after the mail-corpus fix #199, ~313k leafs):

- **mail** — BOTH corpora index into the brain: live `var/corpus/mail`
  (inbox 50 + PST) AND legacy `var/mail` (215k message.md: tb-andriy-profile,
  tb-backup-128g, tb-2010-zip, contacts_eml, defacto, gmail_*, inbox).
  `bin/brain/index.go --with-mail` loads `brain.MailRoots()` (multi-root +
  sha256 de-dupe by leaf id). Mail is only in the brain if the index ran with
  `--with-mail`.
- **git history** — `bin/brain/import-git.go --root <dir>` (docs + git corpus).
- **chats** — telegram/linkedin/whatsapp message.md (`--with-chats`).
- **docs** — README/PLAN/AGENTS/docs/* (default).

If a search misses mail that exists on disk: the brain was rebuilt WITHOUT
`--with-mail`, or `var/mail` was never indexed. Fix:
`bin/stack/sync.go --with-mail` (wave step `mail-index`) or
`bin/brain/index.go --skip --with-mail` (resume/append, de-duped, idempotent).
`bin/brain/stats.go` must show info ≥ ~200k on the ops host; anything less
means a corpus is missing.

```bash
bin/brain/search.go "Matrix federation"                # pointers + snippets, YAML
bin/brain/search.go "onlyoffice postgres" --root facts # restrict to confirmed
bin/brain/search.go "where is cs-lexicon" --json | yq '.[].ref'
bin/brain/search.go "who works where" --as-of 2025-01-01  # D24 intervals
bin/brain/add.go --text T --root facts --source "a.md x b.md"
bin/brain/get.go <id> --body                           # full chunk only when needed
bin/brain/stats.go                                     # index health
bin/brain/eval.go                                      # recall@5 >= 0.95 gate (Go, via Zig CGO)
```

`bin/kb/search` is a deprecated wrapper. `--hop N` walks
`FROM_FILE` / `HAS_VERSION` / `AUTHORED` from each hit (1=File, 3=Person).
`--as-of YYYY-MM-DD` keeps leafs whose `valid_from`/`valid_to` cover that day
(empty interval = always; not D16 source staleness).

## Rules

- Search before you read. Never grep a repo for a concept the graph covers.
- `--root facts` returns only confirmed evidence-linked answers. Default shows
  facts first, then info leafs clearly marked `(not confirmed)`.
- If there is no facts hit, `bin/brain/search.go` consults SearXNG and adds a
  `web` block (kept apart from graph hits). `throttled` / `skipped` / `refused`
  are not evidence of absence. `--root facts|info` and `--no-web` skip the web.
- If recall looks wrong, run `bin/brain/eval.go`; it gates control questions and
  should stay at or above 95% recall@5.
- Contradictions (≥2 yes vs ≥2 no) stay `(not confirmed)` until
  `bin/facts/audit contradict` fires `temporal_freshness` or `authority_pairing`.
- Agents: `GET /openapi.json` and `POST /mcp` on `bin/brain/serve.go` (same
  handlers; tool names match paths `search`/`get`/`stats`/`audit`). Generated
  list: [tools.md](tools.md).
- Never report an unconfirmed single-source local answer as fact.
